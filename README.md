## 📖 Overview

This project is a console-based simulation of the naval combat game **Battleship**. It features a turn-based system where a **Human Player** competes against an **AI Opponent**. The project was designed with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, specifically leveraging polymorphism, inheritance, and dynamic memory management.

The game features a rich ASCII interface with real-time fleet health tracking, input validation, and an "intelligent" AI that hunts for ships without repeating moves.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Smart AI Opponent:** The AI randomizes attacks but remembers previous moves to avoid hitting the same tile twice.
* **🛡️ Robust Input Validation:** Prevents crashes by handling non-integer inputs, out-of-bounds coordinates, and overlapping ship placements.
* **📊 Dynamic Fleet Status:** A real-time "Health Bar" display for every ship, showing remaining hit points and sunk status.
* **💻 Cross-Platform Compatible:** Uses preprocessor directives to handle console clearing on both Windows (`cls`) and Linux/Mac (`clear`).
* **🎨 Clean ASCII UI:** Features a high-visibility grid with distinct symbols for Hits `[X]`, Misses `[M]`, Ships `[S]`, and Water `[~]`.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Deployment Phase:**
    * You will be prompted to place 5 ships: **Carrier (5)**, **Battleship (4)**, **Cruiser (3)**, **Submarine (3)**, and **Destroyer (2)**.
    * Enter coordinates (Row 0-9, Column 0-9) and orientation (H for Horizontal, V for Vertical).
2.  **Battle Phase:**
    * Enter target coordinates to fire at the enemy grid.
    * The game provides immediate feedback: **Hit**, **Miss**, or **Sunk**.
3.  **Victory:**
    * The first player to sink the entire enemy fleet wins the game!

## 🛠️ Installation & Compilation

You can compile this project using any standard C++ compiler (like `g++`).

### 1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone [https://github.com/MatanShtar/Battleships-CPP.git](https://github.com/MatanShtar/Battleships-CPP.git)
cd Battleships-CPP

2. Compile
Run the following command in your terminal to link all source files:

       g++ main.cpp Game.cpp Player.cpp HumanPlayer.cpp AiPlayer.cpp Grid.cpp Ship.cpp ShipClasses.cpp -o battleship
   
4. Run
Windows:

       battleship.exe
Mac/Linux:

    ./battleship
🏗️ Technical Architecture
This project uses a modular class hierarchy to separate logic, state, and user interaction.

Class Diagram Overview
  • Game: The central controller. Manages the game loop, turns, and win conditions.

  • Grid: Represents the 10x10 board. Handles logic for collisions, boundaries, and cell states (WATER, SHIP, HIT, MISS).

  • Player (Abstract Base Class):

    • Defines the interface for placeAllShips() and makeMove().

    • Manages the Grid and the array of Ship* pointers.

    • HumanPlayer: Implements logic for user input via std::cin.

    • AiPlayer: Implements logic for randomized, valid computer moves.

  • Ship (Base Class):

    • Tracks health, size, and location.

    • Derived Classes: Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer (each with specific sizes).

Code Snippet: Polymorphism
The game loop treats both Human and AI generically using the base Player pointer:

    C++

    // Inside Game::start()
    // The game doesn't need to know IF it is a Human or AI, just that it is a Player.
    player1->makeMove(player2); 
    if (player2->allShipsSunk()) { /* Win Logic */ }
    
    player2->makeMove(player1);
    if (player1->allShipsSunk()) { /* Win Logic */ }
